# Payroll-System
Payroll Management System (PMS) is a system that is used to maintain records of all the employees working in an organization, providing an easy GUI to the Admin to generate Pay-Slips. At the front end of the system, I have used JAVA Abstract Windows Toolkit(AWT) and MySQL for maintaining databases. The project proceeds through a sequence of well-designed code with validation of security, consistency, reliability.
